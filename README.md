# university-undergraduate
This repository is used to store all of my university projects. The projects are organized by stage, with a folder for each year and semester.

To find a specific project, navigate to the appropriate folder and then open the README file for that project. The README file will contain more information about the project, such as the project description, instructions on how to run the project, and any other relevant information.

I hope this repository is helpful to you. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
